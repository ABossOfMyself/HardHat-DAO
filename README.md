# HardHat-DAO

## Decentralized Autonomous Organization

<h4>

-   A DAO is a collectively-owned, blockchain-governed organization working towards a shared mission.

-   DAO is an entity structure in which tokenholders participate in the management and decision-making of an entity.

-   There is no central authority of a DAO. Instead, power is distributed across tokenholders who collectively cast votes.

-   All votes and activity through the DAO are posted on a blockchain, making all actions of users publicly viewable.

-   DAO is an organization created by developers to automate decisions and facilitate cryptocurrency transactions.

-   A DAO must ensure security is prioritized, as exploits can leave a DAO drained of millions of dollars of its treasury savings.
